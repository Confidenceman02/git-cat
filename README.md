# Git Cat

A fun project I started to get familiar with the svg api. My aim was to use no animation libraries and hand roll all the eye animations myself.

Each eye is created with svg quadratic curves and the control points are being animated to simulate the eye blink.

I created a basic (lerp) function to make the animations a little more realistic. (lerp's) are used quite frequently in animating things to give the ease in/ease out effect.
